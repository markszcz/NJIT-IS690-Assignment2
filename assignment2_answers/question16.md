## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

16. **What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and how is it implemented in your project?**

RBAC is gatekeeping certain actions or returned data based on a users role. For example you can either deny access to an API based on the users rold or the same API can give back different information based on the type of user who accesses the data. In the project we have "Admin and Manager" role that can be assigned to a users.
