## Pytest

5. **Why is Pytest critical for the development of the API?**

Pytest is critical for our development of APIs to ensure the quality and realiability of what we are buidling. Pytest lets us test our API functionality by creating unit tests, for example testing to make sure we can test valid requests or even the oposite, invalid ones and catch edge cases. Pytest also lets us isolate runs to test specific scenarios and lets us reuses these tests for other environments, such as Test/pre production. Lastly Pytest can also let use mock dependencies when testing the API, such as databases, thus isolating third party potential issues.
